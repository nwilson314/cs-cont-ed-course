# Handmade hero
Handmade hero is a game engine written in C++ that uses the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library. It follows the original [Handmade Hero tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnuhp3Xd9PYTt6svyQPyRO_AAuMWGxPzU) with help from [Handmade Penguin](https://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin/default.html) (which, while incomplete, is also really good) for SDL2 conversion from the original Win32.

I've included it in this specific repository for a couple of reasons:
- I wanted to get better at reading and writing C++.
- I've heard that when this series released, many of the programmers I admire pointed to it changing their career.
- A full game engine in C++ will force me to understand many of the topics that I am wanting to cover in the other, more formal "courses."
- This specific tutorial, following episodic, 1 hour tutorial videos is perfect for a "course" and honestly aligns fairly well with an undergraduate Game Engine course.

As I am following along with the tutoral almost exactly, there isn't much code that I am creating from scratch.
