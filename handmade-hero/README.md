# Handmade hero
Handmade hero is a game engine written in C++ that uses the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library. This repo follows the original [Handmade Hero tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnuhp3Xd9PYTt6svyQPyRO_AAuMWGxPzU) with help from [Handmade Penguin](https://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin/default.html) (which, while incomplete, is also really good) for SDL2 conversion from the original Win32.

The major difference here is that I am using Odin instead of the original C++ game engine. Originally, I had been using C++ but decided that I would like to get familiar with Odin and this seemed like a good opportunity to do so.

I've included it in this specific repository for a couple of reasons:
- I wanted to get better at reading ~~and writing~~ C++. The original series will still be interpreted through the C++ it was written in. However, I no longer will get much practice writing C++, but I think that is a fine tradeoff.
- I wanted to learn the basics of Odin. It's an intriquing language and I have heard a lot of good things about it.
- I've heard that when this series released, many of the programmers I admire pointed to it changing their career.
- A full game engine in C++/Odin will force me to understand many of the topics that I am wanting to cover in the other, more formal "courses."
- This specific tutorial, following episodic, 1 hour tutorial videos is perfect for a "course" and honestly aligns fairly well with an undergraduate Game Engine course.

As I am following along with the tutoral almost exactly, there isn't much code that I am creating from scratch. Though in the changing to Odin, there will be some necesaary updates.
